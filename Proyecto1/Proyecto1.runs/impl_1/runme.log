WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net GuitarSep_i/ScoreDisplay_0/U0/leds/led6_g_reg/G0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin GuitarSep_i/ScoreDisplay_0/U0/leds/led6_g_reg/L3_2/O, cell GuitarSep_i/ScoreDisplay_0/U0/leds/led6_g_reg/L3_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
